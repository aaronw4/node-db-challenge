- [ ] Explain the difference between `Relational Databases` and `SQL`.

A relational database describes the type database that you have

SQL is how we interact with a database.

- [ ] Why do tables need a `primary key`?

The primary key insures that every row in that table is unique.

Foreign key

- [ ] What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables.
